        <h2>Registration System</h2>
        <p>My first introduction to OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) was during an undergraduate course called,
            appropriately, Object-Oriented Programming. In this course, we learned and practiced the key concepts of
            OOP. Before that, my programming experience was mainly with the C language, where I developed automation
            solutions using microcontrollers and the Arduino platform to prototype automation systems. I also used
            MATLAB for plotting graphs and developing controllers for various applications.</p>
        <p>This first exposure to OOP was very successful, and it sparked my interest in the language and what I could
            achieve with it. I began learning more on my own, taking courses and working on projects. Through
            conversations with developer friends, I discovered C# and became fascinated by its versatility, which
            motivated me to dive deeper into learning it. This led to the project that follows:</p>
        <p>As I already had some concepts from Java, I decided to explore C# by creating a system that simulates a
            registration program with full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality. Initially, I set up a
            local server using Apache on my machine to begin development and testing. Later, I hosted the database
            online using my website's domain to make the application more realistic.</p>
        <p>Below is a screenshot of the login page, where credential validation is implemented:</p>

        <h3>Key Learnings from This Project:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Creating an Online Database Hosted on a Domain:</strong> This was a new and challenging
                experience for me, but I now have a clear understanding of the process.</li>
            <li><strong>SQL:</strong> Although I had worked with SQL queries before, this project taught me how to
                interact with the backend more effectively, handling queries with multiple parameters.</li>
            <li><strong>MySQL:</strong> I used the MySQL framework in this project to access and manage data, learning
                its key features along the way.</li>
            <li><strong>Windows Forms:</strong> I enhanced my knowledge of Windows Forms, particularly in accessing and
                utilizing its methods.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Overall, this was a very interesting and rewarding project that gave me a solid foundation and a clearer
            understanding of how to apply these skills in future applications.</p>
