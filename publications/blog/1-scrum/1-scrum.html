        <h2>What are the scrum ceremonies and who participates?</h2>
        <p>After diving into Scrum methodologies recently, I found that one of the key aspects that makes Scrum so
            efficient in software development is the set of ceremonies or meetings that guide the team's workflow. These
            ceremonies help structure the process, ensure continuous progress, and improve collaboration. If you're new
            to Scrum like I was, here's a breakdown of the key ceremonies and who participates in them.</p>
        <h3>1. <strong>Sprint Planning</strong></h3>
        <p><strong>Purpose</strong>: Sprint Planning kicks off each sprint. The goal is to define what can be delivered
            during the sprint and how the team will approach the work.</p>
        <p><strong>Who Participates</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Product Owner</strong>: Sets the priority and explains which features or tasks are most
                important from the backlog.</li>
            <li><strong>Scrum Master</strong>: Facilitates the meeting, ensuring it stays on track and that the Scrum
                principles are followed.</li>
            <li><strong>Development Team</strong>: They decide how much work they can commit to and break the work down
                into smaller tasks.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>2. <strong>Daily Scrum (Standup)</strong></h3>
        <p><strong>Purpose</strong>: The Daily Scrum is a short meeting (usually 15 minutes) where the team discusses
            progress towards the sprint goal and addresses any obstacles.</p>
        <p><strong>Who Participates</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Development Team</strong>: Shares what they worked on yesterday, what they'll work on today, and
                any blockers they are facing.</li>
            <li><strong>Scrum Master</strong>: Makes sure the meeting is short and productive. They also help remove any
                blockers identified by the team.</li>
            <li><strong>Product Owner</strong>: May attend but typically listens to understand progress without actively
                directing the discussion.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>3. <strong>Sprint Review</strong></h3>
        <p><strong>Purpose</strong>: At the end of the sprint, the team holds a Sprint Review to demonstrate the work
            they've completed. This is a chance to gather feedback and ensure everyone is aligned on the progress.</p>
        <p><strong>Who Participates</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Product Owner</strong>: Reviews and accepts the work that meets the agreed-upon criteria.</li>
            <li><strong>Development Team</strong>: Demonstrates the work completed during the sprint.</li>
            <li><strong>Scrum Master</strong>: Facilitates the meeting.</li>
            <li><strong>Stakeholders</strong>: Provide feedback and discuss potential next steps based on the outcome.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>4. <strong>Sprint Retrospective</strong></h3>
        <p><strong>Purpose</strong>: The Retrospective is a meeting focused on continuous improvement. The team reflects
            on what went well, what didn&rsquo;t, and how they can improve in the next sprint.</p>
        <p><strong>Who Participates</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Development Team</strong>: Shares insights about the sprint process.</li>
            <li><strong>Scrum Master</strong>: Facilitates the meeting, encouraging open discussion and suggesting
                improvements.</li>
            <li><strong>Product Owner</strong>: Can participate, though the focus is usually on the team's workflow and
                process, not the product itself.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Why Are These Ceremonies Important?</h3>
        <p>As someone learning more about development and Scrum, I&rsquo;ve found that these ceremonies create a rhythm
            for the team. They ensure that everyone is on the same page, the work is focused on the highest priorities,
            and issues are addressed quickly. Each meeting serves a unique purpose but is critical for maintaining
            alignment and continuous improvement throughout the sprint.</p>
        <p>If you're new to Scrum, these ceremonies can feel a bit formal at first, but I've come to appreciate how they
            keep things organized and focused. They create accountability and structure, which is key to delivering
            high-quality software efficiently.</p>
