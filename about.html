            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p><strong>Hello, my name is Ronaldo. I'm 27 years old, and I'm from Rio Grande do Sul,
                    Brazil.</strong><br /></p>
            <p>In 2021, I graduated in Control and Automation Engineering from IFRS, and I've
                been working in mechanical design for the past 5 years.</p>
            <p>Currently, I work as a machine developer for the shoe industry. My job involves more than just receiving
                client requirements and designing a machine to meet them. It's about understanding the real issue and
                improving the process as a whole. This includes involving the client in problem-solving and managing
                timelines to ensure all areas progress in sync, delivering the product just in time.</p>
            <p>Since the start of my engineering degree, I've enjoyed the dynamics and possibilities of programming,
                particularly in C, and working on projects with Arduino, which uses a C++-like language, albeit
                simplified. During my time as a mechanical draftsman, I developed automated Excel tables and enhanced
                SolidWorks VBA macros to accelerate the design process.</p>
            <p>About a year ago, I decided to change my career focus and began studying software development. I have
                completed courses in Java, VBA, Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Now, I am looking for an opportunity
                to apply my knowledge in practice and learn from more experienced developers.</p>
            <p>I created this page not only to show recruiters that I'm committed to gaining knowledge and pursuing
                opportunities but also for the following reasons:</p>
            <ol>
                <br>
                <li><strong>To continue learning programming logic</strong>, especially through HTML, CSS, and
                    JavaScript. While my main focus is on Java and C#, I believe having a flexible understanding of
                    multiple languages is crucial for sustainable growth in this career.</li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>To share historical curiosities</strong> I&rsquo;ve learned from books, museums, videos,
                    podcasts, and conversations. When I was younger, I didn&rsquo;t appreciate history because of how it
                    was taught. Now, I find it fascinating&mdash;understanding history requires seeing things from
                    others&rsquo; perspectives to truly grasp the significance of the facts.</li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>To improve my English skills.</strong> That's why the entire website is written in English.
